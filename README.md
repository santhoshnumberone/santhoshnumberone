# 👋 Hi, I'm Santhosh — Future AI Product Manager, Builder at Heart

I'm a C++/Python developer and former machine vision engineer, now specializing in **LLM prototyping and GenAI product development**. My focus is on building useful, privacy-conscious AI tools using local/offline workflows — while developing the strategic skills of an AI Product Manager.

---

### 🧠 My Current Stack

Building and experimenting with:
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers
- 🔗 LangChain (agents, tools, memory)
- 🧠 SentenceTransformers for semantic search
- 🧩 llama.cpp for running quantized local models (GGUF, 4-bit, CPU-optimized)
- 📁 Lightweight vector databases (FAISS)
- 🧪 Google Colab + open-source inference pipelines

---

### 🎯 Career Focus

I’m actively transitioning into:
- 🚀 **AI Product Management** — focused on LLM tools, workflows, and devtools
- 💼 High-impact **Prompt Engineering** + rapid prototyping roles
- 🧩 Teams solving problems in search, reasoning, and agent reliability

I bring 5+ years of engineering experience and a product mindset grounded in:
- Strategic thinking from first principles
- User empathy + fast feedback cycles
- Building lean, functional prototypes under real-world constraints
