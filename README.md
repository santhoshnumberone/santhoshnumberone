# 👋 Hi, I'm Santhosh — LLM Prototyper in Progress

I'm a C++/Python developer with a background in machine vision systems, currently transitioning full-time into **LLM prototyping, AI R&D, and offline/Colab-based GenAI workflows**.

I'm building public projects using:
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers
- 🔗 LangChain
- 🧠 SentenceTransformers
- 📁 Offline vector databases like FAISS
- 🧪 Google Colab + lightweight APIs

---

### 🚧 Currently In Progress

- 🎓 [**Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT** (Coursera, Vanderbilt)](https://coursera.org/share/7197a7bd0ae717ecced1ed917a54f3e8)
- 🧠 **LangChain for LLM App Development** (DeepLearning.AI).
- 🔬 **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers** (OpenAI + DeepLearning.AI) – _[queued]_

### 🔨 Coming Soon Projects (Mid-May to June 2025)

| Project Name         | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `chat-with-folder`   | Offline chatbot for PDFs + docs using sentence-transformers |
| `rag-colab-starter`  | Google Colab RAG demo using LangChain + FAISS |
| `llm-prompt-lab`     | Prompt testing sandbox for offline and API-based models |

### 👨‍💻 Past Tech Experience

Before pivoting to GenAI, I spent 5+ years building front-end tools for industrial machine vision systems using:
- C++ (Gtkmm), Python (PyQt/OpenCV)
- Custom UI for multi-camera inspection systems
- Real-time visual debugging and analytics tools

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔍 [Image Forgery Detection (Interview Challenge)](https://github.com/santhoshnumberone/Image-Forgery-Detection-) -2018
Custom CNN architecture combining Inception and ResNet principles to classify authentic vs. spliced images. Implemented in PyTorch. Includes training graphs and model design. Dataset and weights excluded due to interview constraints.

### 🧭 What I’m Looking For

I'm currently seeking:
- 💼 Global remote roles in **LLM prototyping or GenAI R&D**
- 🔁 Contract/freelance work involving **LangChain, Hugging Face, vector DBs**
- ⚙️ Rapid prototyping teams like Trilogy, Replit, or stealth AI startups
